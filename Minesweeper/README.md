# Overview

For this project, I am trying to get a better understanding of object-oriented programming and how to use it.

I am attempting to create a text-based version of Minesweeper using classes in C++.

I decided to write this program because I enjoy creating games and testing my abilities as a programmer. While this project is unfinished for the time being, I will definitely come back to it when I have time.
